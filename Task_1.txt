The most common types of conditional statements are "if," "else if" (in some languages), and "else." Here's a general explanation along with syntax and examples in a pseudocode-like format:

if (condition):
    // Code to be executed if the condition is true


Example:-
age = 25
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")

Example:-
age = 15
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")
